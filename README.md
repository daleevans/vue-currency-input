# Vue Currency Input
The Vue Currency Input plugin allows an easy input of currency formatted numbers. It provides both a standalone component (`<currency-input>`) and a custom Vue directive (`v-currency`) for decorating existing input components with currency format capabilities.

[Read the guide](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/guide/) to getting started or check out the [examples](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/examples/) to see it in action.

## Features
